## Classification of Computers

**Classification of Computers:**  Computers can be classified based on the technology being used and the way they are designed to perform the various tasks. Computers can be categorized into Digital, Analog and Hybrid based on their design and working:

1.  **Digital Computers :** These are the modern computers which are capable of processing information in discrete form. In digital technology data which can be in the form of letters, symbols or numbers is represented in binary form i.e. 0s and 1s. The digital computers are used in industrial, business and scientific applications. They are quite suitable for large volume data processing.
2.  **Analog Computers :**  These computers are used to process data generated by ongoing physical processes. A thermometer is an example of an analog computer since it measures the change in mercury level continuously. Analog computers are well suited to simulating systems. A simulator helps to conduct experiments repeatedly in real time environment. Some of the common examples are simulations in aircrafts, nuclear power plants, hydraulic and electronic networks.
3.  **Hybrid Computers :**  These use both analog and digital technology. It has the speed of analog computer and the accuracy of a digital computer. It may accept digital or analog signals but an extensive conversion of data from digital to analog and analog to digital has to be done. Hybrid Computers are used as a cost effective means for complex simulations.
4.  **Supercomputers:** These are the most powerful and expensive computers that are used for complex scientific calculations, simulations, and research. They are used in fields such as weather forecasting, cryptography, and nuclear research.
5.  **Mainframe Computers:** These are large and powerful computers that are used by large organizations such as banks, airlines, and government agencies to process massive amounts of data and handle multiple users simultaneously.
6.  **Mini Computers:**  These are smaller and less powerful than mainframe computers, but they are still capable of handling multiple users and processing large amounts of data. They are commonly used by small to medium-sized businesses for accounting, inventory management, and other data-intensive tasks.
7.  **Personal Computers:**  These are small and affordable computers that are designed for individual users. They are commonly used for personal productivity, entertainment, and communication.
8.  **Workstations:**  These are high-performance computers that are used by professionals such as architects, engineers, and designers to run complex software applications for tasks such as 3D modeling, animation, and scientific visualization.
9.  **Embedded Systems:** These are specialized computers that are built into other devices such as cars, appliances, and medical equipment to control their operations and perform specific functions.
10.  **Mobile Devices:**  These are small and portable computers that are designed for on-the-go use, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops
