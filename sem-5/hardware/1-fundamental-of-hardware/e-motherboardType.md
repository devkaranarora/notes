## Types of Motherboard

There are many [types of motherboard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-motherboards/) as shown below.

### 1. Advanced Technology (AT) motherboard

These motherboards have sockets and connectors with six prongs apiece for the power connections. Users frequently have difficulties when attempting to connect and use these power connections because it might be challenging to recognise them. Such motherboards were very popular in the 1980s, and production of them lasted well into the 2000s.

### 2. Standard ATX motherboard

This motherboard comes in 305*244mm (length*breadth) dimensions, these dimensions can vary with different manufacturer. This motherboard offers more expansion slots, up to four slots for RAM, Two or sometimes more than two PCIe slots for dual graphics cards and more USB and other ports for connectivity, also its size gives space in between components for airflow to keep heat in control.

### 3. Micro ATX motherboard

This motherboards come in 244*244 mm (length*breadth) dimensions (these dimensions can vary with different manufacturer.). This Motherboard has less ports and slots as compared to Standard ATX board. This type of motherboard is more suitable for those who don’t want to much connectivity and later upgrades like adding more ram and additional GPU or [Graphics card](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-graphics-card/) and adding PCI cards.

### 4. eXtended ATX motherboard

This motherboard is 344*330 mm dimensions (these dimensions can vary with different manufacturer). This motherboard is designed for both dual CPU and single configuration and has up to 8 ram slots and has more PCIe and PCI slots for adding PCI cards for different purposes.

### 5. Flex ATX motherboard

They are regarded as the most compact members of the ATX family. They had a small price tag and were made to take up the least amount of space possible. Mini ATX was modified into Flex ATX by Intel between 1999 and 2000.

### 6. Low-Profile EXtended (LPX) motherboard

In comparison to previous motherboard, this has two significant changes. The [output and input ports](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-output-ports/) were relocated to the device’s back as the first change, In comparison to previous iterations, and the second change was added a riser card, which makes it simpler to attach components.

### 7. BTX motherboard

A method known as balanced technology extended, or BTX for short, was created to meet the demands of developing technologies, which ask for higher power consumption and, as a result, produce more heat. In order to focus on low-power CPUs, Intel stopped making BTX boards in the middle of the 2000s.

### 8. Pico BTX motherboard

These boards are referred to as Pico due to their small size when compared to a regular motherboard. Despite the fact that the top half of the BTX is shared, two expansion slots are supported. It is made to satisfy the demands of digital applications, and its distinguishing features include the half-height or riser cards.

### 9. Mini ITX motherboard

It is significant to note that the information technology extended (ITX) motherboard does not exist in a standard size. The motherboard has been reduced in size and made smaller than in previous generations in its place. It was created in the 2000s, and it is 17 by 17 centimetres in size.

### 10. Mini STX motherboard

The motherboard presently known as the tiny-STX, which stands for tiny socket technology extended, was originally given the designation “Intel 55”. Despite being a 2015 invention, the motherboard is 147 millimetres by 140 millimetres in size.
