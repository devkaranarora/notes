## What is a Motherboard?

A [computer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-computer-and-its-operations/) is an electronic device that processes the [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) with respect to the user’s requirements using [IO devices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-and-output-devices/). The data processing takes place in a processor, an important component. The processor is situated in a hardware circuit board called the motherboard or [printed circuit board (PCB)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pcb-full-form/).

It connects the [CPU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/central-processing-unit-cpu/), [memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-memory/), hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card, and other parts. It also connects [expansion cards](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flutter-expansion-card/) directly or via cables.

## History of Motherboard

The first-ever motherboard was used by the IBM in early 1980s. It was eventually called a planar. It is the main component through which the communication takes place between the other components and connects all the [peripherals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/peripherals-devices-in-computer-organization/), therefore referred to as the motherboard. A computer is lifeless without a motherboard. The other extensions of the motherboard are referred to as daughter boards.

## How Does a Motherboard Work?

The power supply transfers electricity to the motherboard so that the computer can use it when you turn on the computer. Data buses are used to transfer information between the [southbridge and northbridge](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-north-bridge-and-south-bridge/) component of motherboard.

The northbridge motherboard component is used to make the data connections to the CPU, [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-ram-random-access-memory/), or PCIe. The RAM starts feeding the CPU inputs. Depending on the type of card which you have, after being written to the PCIe the data is either copied or relocated to the expansion card.

The [southbridge motherboard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/motherboard-parts-south-bridge/) component controls the data connection to the [BIOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-basic-input-output-system-bios/), the [universal serial bus (USB)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/universal-serial-bus-usb-in-computer-network/), the [serial advanced technology attachment (SATA)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sata-full-form/), and the PCI bus. now your computer starts because signals sent to BIOS.

The left components interact via an electrical signal. A microchip’s northbridge or southbridge elements pass through data buses. The data will be encoded into a [programming language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-programming-languages/) (1 and 0). When a signal is transfer to a motherboard, the motherboard will start processing and translate information into a language the other component can comprehend.

## Components of Motherboard

A motherboard is made of plastic and silicon as well. It is a hub of a computer system. A motherboard is a complex component with various kinds of ports, slots, cables connected to it.  
Some of them are:

-   ****CPU Slot:**** The CPU can be installed in this space. It serves as a connector between a motherboard and a microprocessor. It makes the CPU easier to operate and guards against harm when installing or removing it. It also has a lock to stop the CPU from moving and a heat sink to get rid of the additional heat.
-   ****RAM Slot:**** The RAM (Random Access Memory) is installed in a memory slot or socket on the motherboard. A computer may have two or more memory slots.
-   ****Expansion Slot:**** It is often referred to as an extension port or a bus slot. It is a connection or port on the motherboard that offers a place to put an expansion card for components. It goes by the names bus slot and expansion port as well. It is a port or connection on the motherboard that offers a place to add a hardware expansion card. For instance, you could buy a video expansion card, put it in the expansion slot, and then install a new video card in the computer. AGP, [AMR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-amradaptive-multi-rate-codec/), CNR, PCI, and other popular expansion slots in computers are only a few examples.
-   ****Capacitor:**** Two conducting plates and a thin insulator are placed together to form a capacitor. These components are contained in a plastic bag.
-   ****Inductor(Coil):**** A conducting wire is wrapped around an iron core to create an electromagnetic coil known as an inductor. It stores magnetic energy by functioning as an electromagnet or inductor.
-   ****Northbridge:**** An integrated chip called the northbridge enables communication between the CPU interface, AGP, and memory. Additionally, it enables communication between the southbridge chip and the graphics controller, CPU, and RAM.
-   ****Southbridge:**** Controls the input and output functions. Due to its location, it is referred to as southbridge. it enables communication between the northbridge chip.
-   ****USB Port:**** You can attach hardware like a mouse and keyboard to your computer using the USB port.
-   ****PCI Slot:**** This term refers to a slot. It enables you to connect [Peripheral Component Interconnect Slot(PCI)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/peripheral-component-interconnect-pci/) hardware, like as sound and video cards, network hardware, and modems. These are used to connects the peripherals.
-   ****AGP Slot:**** This is referred to as an [Accelerated Graphics Port(AGP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-agpaccelerated-graphics-port/) slot. The slot for connecting graphics cards is provided. It is used for displaying graphics on the screen.
-   ****Heat Sink:**** The heat created by the computer processor is absorbed and dispersed by the heat sink. Its main function is to cool down the CPU by absorbing the heat while the system is running.
-   ****Power Connector:**** The purpose of the power connector is to give power to the motherboard.
-   ****CMOS Battery:**** Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor is the abbreviation for the [CMOS Battery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-need-of-cmos-battery-in-computers/). It is a storage memory. A battery that provides backup power.
-   ****Integrated Circuits (IC):**** IC is also very important component of motherboard. [Integrated circuit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-integrated-circuits/) is used for data processing and storage.



## Features of Motherboard

A motherboard comes with following features:

-   Motherboard varies greatly in supporting various types of components.
-   Motherboard supports a single type of CPU and few types of memories.
-   Video cards, Hard drives, Sound cards have to be compatible with the motherboard to function properly.
-   Motherboard, Cases, and Power supplies must be compatible to work properly together.

## Advantages of Motherboard

-   A motherboard is the main component without it a computer cannot function.
-   Any peripheral can be connected and data transfer is faster.

## FAQs on Motherboard

### Q.1: Where is motherboard located?

****Answer:****

> The majority of the components and computer peripherals connect to a motherboard inside the computer chassis. The motherboard, which is the largest circuit board in tower computers, is located on either the left or right side of the tower.

### Q.2: Why do motherboards need cooling?

****Answer:****

> Voltage regulator modules (VRMs), one component on motherboards, can become warm during use because of it motherboard need cooling.
