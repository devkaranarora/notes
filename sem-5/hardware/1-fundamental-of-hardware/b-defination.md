## Definition

Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as a case, central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), monitor, and mouse which processes the input according to the set of instructions provided to it by the user and gives the desired output.

The computer has mainly has two major components:

1.  Hardware
2.  Software

Computer hardware is a physical device of computers that we can see and touch. For e.g. [Monitor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monitor-vs-semaphore/), [Central Processing Unit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/central-processing-unit-cpu/), [Mouse, Joystick](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-mouse-and-joystick/), etc. Using these devices, we can control computer operations like [input and output](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-and-output-devices/).

## Computer Hardware Parts

These hardware components are further divided into the following categories, which are:

1.  Input Devices
2.  Output Devices
3.  Storage Devices
4.  Internal Components

## Hardware Components

Some important hardware devices known as the internal components are discussed below:

### 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU is also known as the heart of the computer. It consists of three units, generally known as the control unit, [Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-alu-and-data-path/), and the [memory unit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-memory-and-memory-units/). Below is the block diagram of the CPU is given:

As shown in the diagram input is given to the CPU through input devices. This input goes to memory and the control unit gets instructions from memory. The control unit now decides what to do with the input or instructions and transfers it to ALU. Now, ALU performs various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logical operations, etc. After that, the final result gets stored in memory and finally passed to output devices to give the output. So, this is how the CPU works.

### 2. Motherboard

It is the main circuit board inside a computer and it contains most of the electronic components together. All the components of the computer are directly or indirectly connected to the [motherboard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-motherboard/). It includes [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/) slots, controllers, system chipsets, etc.

### 3. RAM (Random Access Memory)

It is also known as temporary or volatile memory. It holds the program and data, which are currently in process or processing. All the data is erased as soon as the computer is turned off or in case of a power failure. Data stored in this memory can be changed. There are two types of RAM:-

1.  ****SRAM (Static RAM):**** [SRAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sram-full-form/) basically consists of a flip-flop using a transistor or Mosfet (MOS). It is fast and has less access time. In this refreshing circuits are not required. But it is costly and requires more space. For e.g. cache memory.
2.  ****DRAM (Dynamic RAM):****  [DRAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dram-full-form/) consists of capacitors and the data is stored in the form of capacitors. [Capacitors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/energy-stored-in-a-capacitor/) charge when data is 1 and don’t charge if data is 0. It requires refreshing circuits, as leakage of current in the capacitor can occur, so they need to be refreshed to the data. It is slower and has a higher access time. It is cheaper in comparison with [SRAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sram-full-form/). For e.g. Main memory.

### 4. Video Graphics Array Port

A video input commonly used on computer monitors is called a video graphics array (VGA) port. Verifying that there isn’t a loose connection, a damaged cable, or a broken display is one step in troubleshooting a VGA port. Compressed air can also be sprayed inside the VGA port by a computer expert to make sure it’s dust-free.

### 5. Power Supply

All of a computer system’s parts are powered by a power source. Typically, a power cord is used to connect a computer tower to an electrical outlet. By turning off the computer, unplugging and separating the power supply cord, or trying a different cord or socket, a technician can diagnose the power supply.

### 6. Cooling Fan

A computer’s system to prevent overheating uses cooling fans. To aid customers who use their computers intensively, such as when streaming video or playing games, many computers contain more than one cooling fan. If a user detects their computer overheating, a computer expert might need to repair the cooling fan. The blades may be examined for any damage and cleared of any foreign objects. A technician’s standard method of [troubleshooting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/10-tips-for-troubleshooting-your-pc/) may involve replacing computer fans.

### 7. Hard Drive

On a computer system, files, programs, and other types of information are stored on hard drives, which are data storage devices. They utilise hard drives, which are magnetically coated discs used to store digital versions of information. A computer technician can suspect a corrupt hard disk when a hard drive dies.

## Relationship Between Computer Hardware and Software

-   Both the [Hardware and software](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hardware-and-software/) are mutually dependent on each other. Each should function properly so that the computer produces an output.
-   Software utilization can not be done without supporting of the hardware.
-   Relevant software should be loaded into the hardware to get the latest software.
-   Hardware is a one-time expense while software is not.
-   Software development is very expensive while hardware cant be developed if in use once.
-   Many software applications and their sub-applications can be loaded on hardware to run different jobs.
-   The software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.
